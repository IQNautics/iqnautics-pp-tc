<h2 id="toc_17"></h2>

<h2 id="toc_18">4.   Services and functionalities</h2>

<h3 id="toc_19">4.1</h3>

<p>The Services may be accessed only via an iPhone or iPad device (&quot;Device&quot;). </p>

<h3 id="toc_20">4.2</h3>

<p>Registered Users may access the following Services and functionalities of the IQN App:</p>

<h5 id="toc_21">i.    creating a flotilla and adding other skippers to it.</h5>

<h5 id="toc_22">ii.   seeing flotilla members’ location, speed and distance relative to the Registered User. In this way it is easier to provide assistance in case of need or better time Registered Users’ arrivals by knowing the location of all members of a Registered Users’ flotilla.</h5>

<h5 id="toc_23">iii.  logging the Registered Users’ personal bests such as nautical miles covered during trips or highest speed reached on water when the Registered User is in an active flotilla.</h5>

<h5 id="toc_24">iv.   visualizing location information of all flotilla members on a map for easier coordination as a group and details of each flotilla member such as: current speed, distance relative to your location, their GPS coordinates.</h5>

<h5 id="toc_25">v.    allowing other Registered Users in the same flotilla to easily find you if you found for example a swimming or fishing spot.</h5>

<h5 id="toc_26">vi.   facilitating support for another boater in a Registered Users’ flotilla also allowing for an estimation of how long it will take to get to the location of the said Registered User.</h5>

<h5 id="toc_27">vii.  support in getting a Registered User’s boat next to his or her fellow skippers in a marina by providing information on the exact place where they are and providing the possibility go directly to them without wasting time in a marina.</h5>

<h5 id="toc_28">viii. supporting the organisation of all boats if planning to approach a certain location by providing information to Registered Users in the same flotilla about who is who and where they are for easy and on the spot planning.</h5>

<h5 id="toc_29">ix.   inviting a Registered Users’ charter company representative or marina representative to his or her flotilla so that they can see the exact arrival time. In this way they will be there just in time to give to the Registered User the needed support.</h5>

<h3 id="toc_30">4.3</h3>

<p>Future development of the IQN App will include but shall not be limited to posting comments, photos and other materials (“User Content”).</p>

<h3 id="toc_31">4.4</h3>

<p>Access to the AIS Marine Traffic Information Service</p>

<h5 id="toc_32">i.    What is AIS?</h5>

<p>The automatic identification system – AIS - for vessel tracking is considered one of the most significant developments in navigation safety since the introduction of the radar. Data collected through AIS allows commercial vessels to view other vessels by way of a continuous transmission of the vessels’ position, identification details, speed and course, along with other relevant information to other AIS equipped entities.</p>

<h5 id="toc_33">ii.   What kind of AIS information is available to IQN’s App users?</h5>

<p>IQN’s AIS Related Data offered through our application allows Registered Users to see the location of boats that are equipped with the AIS system. Such information refers to the name of the boat, speed and location (“AIS Related Data”). The AIS Related Data to which IQN users have access via the IQN App provides information only from terrestrial antennas. </p>

<h5 id="toc_34">iii.  How does it work?</h5>

<p>IQN receives AIS Related Data from a shared AIS data platform. Each user of the AIS platform has an AIS antenna and sends the information feed to the third party AIS platform. The AIS third party platform then offers access to the information provided by other users who send AIS information. IQN operates its own AIS antennas and shares this data with the third-party provider. The antenna sends data to the AIS platform, this information being transmitted by radio waves by boats automatically.</p>

<h5 id="toc_35">iv.   Disclaimer</h5>

<p>IQN is not responsible for the accuracy of the AIS Related Data available to Registered Users. IQN shall not be liable towards any Registered Users of the IQN App or any third parties for any direct or indirect loss, damage or loss of a commercial opportunity whatsoever resulting from the use or reliability on the AIS Related Data. 
By accepting these TCS, Registered Users acknowledge and agree that they will not use the AIS Related for commercial purposes by them, their affiliates, agents, employees or any other individual or entity with they are connected in any way.</p>

<h3 id="toc_36">4.5 IQNautics Smart Traffic</h3>

<h4 id="toc_37">4.5.1</h4>

<p>When launching the IQN App and on water, the IQNautics Smart Traffic allows Registered Users to be located on the map just as boats in AIS system.</p>

<h4 id="toc_38">4.5.2</h4>

<p>Registered Users’ information related to travel speed and their location at that time is becoming visible to other Registered Users. As opposed to the AIS Related Data, the IQNautics Smart Traffic does not share the name of the boat of Registered Users. The default text appearing next to the Registered Users’ boats is “IQN User”. </p>

<h4 id="toc_39">4.5.3</h4>

<p>Such text may not be changed by the Registered Users. One important aspect of the IQNautics Smart Traffic is that all Registered Users who use the IQN App while on the water will be presented on the map automatically. Registered Users do not have the option to turn off this functionality. Therefore, the usage of the IQN App comes bundled with the IQNautics Smart Traffic feature.</p>

<h2 id="toc_40">5.   User content</h2>

<h3 id="toc_41">5.1</h3>

<p>Users and Registered Users grant to the Company a non-exclusive licence to access, publish and use in any way the User Content for the purposes of the functioning of the IQN App and the Services or for other legitimate purpose of IQN. Users and Registered Users declare and represent that are the owners or have the right to license or disclose the User Content. Users and Registered Users are fully liable for any damages that might be caused to the Company and/or third parties as a consequence of the Company’s use of the User Content or disclosure via the IQN App.</p>

<h3 id="toc_42">5.2</h3>

<p>Users and Registered Users shall refrain from posting in the IQN App defamatory and/or explicit material. Failure to comply with this provision triggers the Registered Users’ liability for any direct or indirect damages caused to IQN or third parties.</p>

<h2 id="toc_43">6.   Changes and suspension of the IQN App</h2>

<h3 id="toc_44">6.1. Changes to the IQN App</h3>

<h4 id="toc_45">6.1.1</h4>

<p>IQN may continuously update the IQN App and reserves the right to perform changes from time to time in how IQN offers, provides and operates the IQN App. To this end, IQN may, in its sole discretion, from time to time, change, vary or amend the form, appearance, functionality and content of the IQN App and Services, including through updates and upgrades.</p>

<h4 id="toc_46">6.1.2</h4>

<p>The updates and upgrades to the IQN App which may become available from time to time, shall be free of charge and users will be required to download and install the updates and upgrades from the Devices’ relevant virtual store in order to continue to use the IQN App. </p>

<h4 id="toc_47">6.1.3</h4>

<p>Depending on the type of update or upgrade, users may not be able to use the IQN App until the latest version of the IQN App has been downloaded. </p>

<h4 id="toc_48">6.1.4</h4>

<p>IQN is under no obligation to notify Registered Users of such changes, updates and upgrades unless such changes materially and adversely affect users’ ability to use the IQN App, in which case Company will endeavour to notify Registered Users via email of the changes at least 48 hours before the changes come into effect. </p>

<h4 id="toc_49">6.1.5</h4>

<p>These TCS, as they may be amended further, will apply to all updates and upgrades, unless specified otherwise. Should Registered Users not agree to the changes to the IQN App, they may end their use of the IQN App in the manner detailed in clause 8 below. </p>

<h3 id="toc_50">6.2 Suspension to the IQN App</h3>
